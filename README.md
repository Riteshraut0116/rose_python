**##🌹 Python Turtle Rose Drawing**

This project is a simple yet elegant Python script that uses the built-in turtle graphics library to draw a beautiful red rose with green leaves.

## 🖼️ Final Output

Running the script will open a new window and display the animated drawing of the rose. The final image is a complete flower that fits neatly within the screen.

## 🧠 Technical Description

This script is written in Python and uses only the built-in turtle module—no external libraries required.

## How it works:

Initialization: The script starts by importing the turtle module.

Positioning: The turtle is moved to a suitable starting position to ensure the rose fits well on the canvas.

Drawing & Coloring: The rose and leaves are drawn using a series of turtle commands (circle, forward, left, right, etc.). The rose is filled with red and the leaves with green using fillcolor() and begin_fill()/end_fill().

Completion: The drawing window remains open with turtle.done() so the user can admire the artwork.
